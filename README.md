# store_django
This was test project for my start.
It is ready to start. 
For start you need:
1) Git clone current rep
2) Install python env 
3) Install all from requirements
4) Run from project ./manage.py runserver
5) Follow to net address which write in console


P.S. Would be well, if someone, may be i, correct current templates and css for beautiful views.
